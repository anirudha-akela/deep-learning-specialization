[project] | Convolutional Model: step by step |  Implementing convolutional (CONV) and pooling (POOL) layers in numpy, including both forward propagation and backward propagation.  |
[project] | Convolutional model: Hand Symbol Detection| Built and trained a ConvNet in TensorFlow for a classification problem to classify images of hand symbols for the digits 0-5. |
[project]  | Emotion Detection in Images of Faces | Built a ConvNet model using the Keras API to detect "happy" and "non-happy" faces. |
[project]  | Residual Networks | Implement the basic building blocks of ResNets and put together these building blocks to implement and train a state-of-the-art neural network for image classification. |
[project]  | Autonomous driving - Car detection | Use the YOLO algorithm for object detection on a car detection dataset and find the bounding boxes associated with the cars too. |
